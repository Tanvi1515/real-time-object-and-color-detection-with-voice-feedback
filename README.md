# 🎯 Real-Time Object & Color Detection with Voice Feedback

This mini-project is a computer vision system that detects objects and their colors in real time using a webcam, and provides voice feedback about the detected object.

# 🚀 Features
- Real-time object detection using YOLO/OpenCV
- Color detection using pixel analysis
- Voice feedback using `pyttsx3`
- Live video capture via webcam

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- pyttsx3
- imutils

# 🗂️ Project Structure
├── proj2.py # Main logic for object and color detection with voice
├── video_capture.py # Webcam integration for live feed

# 🎬 How It Works
1. The webcam starts capturing real-time video.
2. `proj2.py` detects objects and their primary color.
3. The system announces the object and its color through voice.
